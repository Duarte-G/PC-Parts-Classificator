## About the Project
This project aims to classify images of computer parts. The model is currently trained to recognize the following classes:
- CPU
- GPU
- Motherboard
- Computer Case
- HDD
- RAM
- Headset
- Monitor
- Mouse
- Keyboard

The approach involves a convolutional neural network (ResNet50V2) fine-tuned with data augmentation techniques to improve robustness and accuracy.
